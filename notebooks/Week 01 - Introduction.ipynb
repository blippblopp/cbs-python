Why aren't we using the more up-to-date Python 3? There's a bit of history: For most of Python's lifetime, each new version of the language would introduce new features, but would try very, very hard to not break any code that other people had already written; in other words, most changes were backwards compatible. In about 2006, however, Python's creator and \"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" Guido van Rossum decided that there were a number of things that he had gotten wrong in the original Python specification, and would like to change. Making those changes would break other people's code, so it was decided to make them all at once. <br /><br />\n",
